## MTA Turnstile Data Project	

The first week of Metis is in the books and as expected, was an exciting whirlwind. Pair programming every morning, followed by math lectures, and coding exercises. 

I came into the bootcamp with a decent math background and a few python projects under my belt. We covered a lot of ground in such a short amount of time. It's hard to believe it was only one week! I probably learned 30% of the material from the instructors, 30% from my classmates, and 30% from my own research. The other 10% is material I have likely already forgotten! I am planning on spending at least one hour each weekend reviewing notes from the prior week and catching up on any odds and ends I may have rushed through or passed over. 

In no particular order, we covered the following topics: 
- git workflow 
- pandas 
- matplotlib 
- seaborn 
- command line 
- jupyter lab notebooks and shortcuts
- jekyln blogs
- presentation skills 
- clean code 

Surprisingly, we didn't just breeze over these topics. We covered them in-depth and my skill level sharply rose in all respects. 

One of the best takeaways was regarding jupyterlab. This tool is bundled in Anaconda and I stared at it almost everyday for the past six months before trying it. I would use jupyter notebook or another IDE to code. Jupyterlab is basically a tricked-out notebook with easy access to text files, csvs, the command line terminal and more.
