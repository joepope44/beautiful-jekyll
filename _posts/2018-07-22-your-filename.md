## Project -- Linear Regression - State Policy On Firearm Usage


![Gun Violence in America](https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/635849554906566488-1921592675_gun20violence.jpg)

For my linear regression roject at Metis I picked the topic of gun violence in America. Since the horrible incident in Parkland, I have seen numerous articles and research papers investigating the efficacy of various local, state and federal policies regarding the use and access of firearms. 

I was mainly inspired by [this Vox article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) from earlier this year, but also Dr. Listman's work more recently found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-gun-death-rate-from-gun-laws-d96041c14198). Listman's work uses R instead of my preferred python, and tree regression instead of traditional linear regression models, however it seemed to be an interesting line of thought to follow.
